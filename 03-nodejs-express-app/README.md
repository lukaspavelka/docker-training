# Example 3: Node.js Express Application

This example demonstrates how to containerize a simple web application built with Node.js and the Express framework.

## Files

-   `Dockerfile`: Instructions to build the Docker image. It uses `node:18-alpine` as a base, sets up a working directory, installs dependencies using `npm ci` (from `package-lock.json` if present), copies the application code, switches to a non-root `node` user, and specifies the command to start the application.
-   `server.js`: A minimal Express application that listens on port 3000 and responds with a "Hello World" message.
-   `package.json`: Defines the project metadata, dependencies (Express), and scripts (like `npm start`).
-   `package-lock.json` (implicitly generated by `npm install` if you run it locally, good to commit): Ensures deterministic installs.

## How to Build

Navigate to this directory (`03-nodejs-express-app`) in your terminal and run:

```bash
docker build -t nodejs-express-example .
```

This command builds a Docker image and tags it as `nodejs-express-example`.

## How to Run

Once the image is built, run it using:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 nodejs-express-example
```

-   `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode.
-   `-p 3000:3000`: Maps port 3000 on your host machine to port 3000 in the container (where the Express app is listening).

Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the "Hello from a Node.js Express app in Docker!" message.

## To Stop the Container

1.  Find the container ID: `docker ps`
2.  Stop the container: `docker stop <container_id>`
3.  Optionally, remove the container: `docker rm <container_id>`
